                Order Diptera: it means that it has two (di) wings (ptera).

                Flies, horse flies, and hoverflies belong to the order Diptera, like mosquitoes. They only have two membranous wings -, the hindwings are transformed into balancers, a distinctive feature of this order. Their mouthparts are adapted for sucking liquids. The adults of some species feed on blood while others do not feed at all during this stage. Larvae can be aquatic or feed on fungi and decaying organic matter.

                Suborder Brachycera
				This suborder (together with the subclass Cyclorrapha) is characterized by antennae with no more than three segments.

                Suborder Nematocera
				The insects of this suborder are the oldest of the Diptera Order. They are recognized by their antennae formed by more than three segments and by the slender body. Mosquitoes and melgae, due to their dependence on water and moisture for the development of the larvae, are usually associated with damp and dank habitats near watercourses.

                The distinctive features of mayflies include short antennae, three long tail filaments at the end of the abdomen, and one or two pairs of extremely delicate wings. When they have forewings (those nearer the head), they are always much larger than the hind wings. In Europe there are around 200 different species. However, it is in the tropics that we can find the greatest number of species. The European species are smaller and live near fresh water.

                Cicadas and hoppers are a very heterogeneous group with a great variety of shapes and habitats, but they all share a very important characteristic: their mouth is modified into a long beak to suck liquids. In many cases, this beak arises from the rear part of the head, very close to the front legs. All homopterans feed on plants, and many species are crop pests. These insects weaken the plants by sucking out large amounts of sap. Many species also inject toxins that damage the plant.

				Order Odonata: it means that it has teeth (odonto).

                The Odonata order is divided in two groups: dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) and damselflies (suborder Zygoptera). Dragonflies and damselflies have excellent vision due to their two large compound eyes, and their powerful toothed mandibles allow them to eat hard-skinned animals, like beetles. Contrary to popular belief, dragonflies do not have a sting (and therefore do not sting). Despite being strange looking insects, they are very useful to humans as they feed on considerable amounts of flies and insects. Dragonflies and damselflies are quite distinctive insects: they are distinguished by their long and slender bodies displaying two pairs of wings, with complex venation. The antennae are very short. There are around 5,700 Odonata species in the world. In Europe there are 120 species of this order, of which 65 can be found in Portugal (42 dragonflies and 23 damselflies).

                Suborder Anisoptera: it means that it has different (aniso) wings (ptera).
				When at rest, dragonflies keep their wings open in an horizontal position. Their strong muscles allow them to have a fast flight and to be effective hunters. Being essentially aquatic animals they need water to complete their life cycle. However, due to their powerful flight ability, adults are often seen far away from the rivers and streams where they were born. Dragonflies are frequently found in forest clearings hunting insects, in places warmed by the sun.

                The Zygoptera, or damselflies, have two identical pairs of wings.  When at rest, they keep their wings closed or slightly open in a vertical position. Their compound eyes, set at opposite positions, form a structure that resembles a small hammer. Damsels are delicate insects with a graceful and slow flight. Since damsels are not very fast, they catch their prey while at rest, usually on vegetation.

				Order Hymenoptera: it means that it has membranous (hymen) wings (ptera)

                The hymenopterans are insects characterized by two pairs of membranous wings with few veins, being the forewings larger than the hindwings. Some hymenoptera, such as ants, are wingless. The order Hymenoptera is the second largest order based on the number of known species – nearly 200,000. In Portugal there are just over 1,000 known species, probably an underestimation of the actual number of species. The hymenopterans perform a number of important roles in our ecosystems, such as pollinators and agents for biological control of other insect populations.

                Suborder Symphyta
				Sawflies are insects with the four membranous wings typical of hymenopterans. However, they are distinguished from the others due to the absence of  the narrow “waist” between the thorax and the abdomen (the “wasp waist”). Their common name, sawfly, comes from their saw-like ovipositor, used to cut the tissue of the plants where eggs are laid. The adults feed from polen.

                The suborder Apocrita represents the majority of Hymenopterans. This group is characterized by the narrow “waist” between the thorax and the abdomen – “the wasp waist”. The Larvae are always surrounded by food, and as such trarely need to move - that is why larvae have small heads and do not have legs.

Most species have two pairs of long, membranous wings with dark spots and the legs are very slender. The antennae are long, with many segments, and the compound eyes are well developed. There are about 500 described species, of which only 30 live in Europe.

				Order Trichoptera: it means that it has hairs (trichos) in the wings (ptera).

                The wings of caddisflies have few cross-veins and are covered in hairs. When the insect is at rest, the wings are held over the body like a roof. The antennae are slender and sometimes very long. Caddisflies might resemble some butterflies: to distinguish them, look for the presence of hairs on the wings and mandibles on the mouth. The adults are not well known: they have very conspicuous colours and patterns, and usually fly at dusk. There are about 13,000 worldwide, but the fauna of many regions remains largely unknown. Tricopterans live in freshwater habitats, and their larvae are aquatic. Unlike most insects, the larval phase of the Trichoptera is the most popular and best known.

                Butterflies and Moths are distinctive insects, usually with two pairs of membranous wings which, like the body, are covered in tiny scales. The mouth-parts form a straw-like proboscis – a long tube used by insects to suck liquids (water and nectar). When the animal is not feeding, the proboscis is coiled under the head. Currently, there are 160,000 to 175,000 known species, but it has been estimated that the total number of lepidopteran species could reach half a million.
                Group Rhopalocera: means that it has the antennae (wax) in the form of a club (rhopalo)
				These species are diurnal and have slender antennae that are club-shaped at the ends. Most species do not protect their pupae or chrysalis inside a cocoon. Another feature that distinguishes this group is the absence of any type of connection between the forewings and the hindwings.

				Group Heterocera: means that it has the antennae (wax) with different forms (hetero).
				Approximately 90% of the lepidopteran are moths. Although this group includes many dark-coloured species which are associated with nocturnal activity (such as the moths that are attracted to light bulbs), it also includes other species that fly during the day, and therefore have brightly coloured wings. The Heterocera group is primarily distinguished by the shape of their antennae, which can be quite diverse (comb, rope or string-like shaped)but are never like the clubbed-shaped antennae of diurnal butterflies.
				In Portugal, about 2600 species have been inventoried and new species are discovered every year, as a result of the work of national and foreign researchers. For more information about our fauna you can explore www.lusoborboletas.org.

                These insects have a large head and a conspicuous first thoracic segment (pronoto) that resembles a horse saddle. The hind legs, which are larger than the other legs, are modified for jumping. There are typically two pairs of wings, being the forewings (the pair nearer the head) thicker. There are more than 15,000 known species worldwide, although mostly found in tropical regions. In Europe, the Mediterranean region is home to the greatest number of species. Another characteristic of the Orthoptera order is their ability to produce sounds.

                Suborder Caelifera:
				Most short-horned grasshoppers live in grasslands and open fields in areas with warm and dry climate. Grasshoppers should not be identified based on their colours and patterns, as these characteristics can vary significantly. Grasshoppers belonging to the same species but living in different places can look very different. Grasshoppers can mimic the colours present in their habitat in order to avoid detection by predators.

                Earwigs are elongated insects with long slender antennae. They have two pairs of wings: the forewings are small and hard pair and called tegmina; the hindwings are extremely thin and membranous.  When at rest, the wings remain elaborately folded under the tegmina. The abdomen has high mobility, with a pair of terminal segments modified as forceps.  In adult males the forceps are strongly curved. These forceps have different functions: they may be used to open the wings, to capture prey, and also as a defence weapon against predators. The Dermaptera represents a relatively small insect order, with around 1,800 species worldwide.

There are more than 350,000 known species worldwide, of which around 8,500 can be found in Portugal. Their diversity is reflected in the variety of habits they can colonize and their ability to explore different types of food resources.
                All stages of beetle development, from larvae to adults, have a mouth adapted for chewing, with well developed jaws. The first pair of wings is called elytra. The presence of the elytra was decisive for the success of this order, giving it a great resistance and ability to colonize several environments.

            <ordem>BUGS - Order Heteroptera</ordem>
            <description>
				Order Heteroptera: it means that it has different (hetero) wings (ptera).

                The name of this order comes from the features of the forewings of these insects, which are hardened on the upper half of the wing, and membranous on the lower half. Generally, bugs have a flattened body, with their wings folded over the body when they are at rest. Like cicadas and hoppers, all heteroptera species have a beak-shaped mouth. Many families have glands near the hind legs which secrete substances with an unpleasant smell.

            <description>
                Order Hymenoptera: it means that it has membranous (hymen) wings (ptera) .

                The hymenopterans are insects characterized by two pairs of membranous wings with few veins, being the forewings larger than the hindwings. Some hymenoptera, such as ants, are wingless. The order Hymenoptera is the second largest order based on the number of known species – nearly 200,000. In Portugal there are just over 1,000 known species, probably an underestimation of the actual number of species. The hymenopterans perform a number of important roles in our ecosystems, such as pollinators and agents for biological control of other insect populations.

                Suborder Apocrita
				This suborder represents the majority of Hymenopterans. This group is characterized by the narrow “waist” between the thorax and the abdomen – “the wasp waist”. The larvae are always surrounded by food, and as such rarely need to move - that is why larvae have small heads and do not have legs.

            <description>
                Order Homoptera: it means that it has equal (homo) wings (ptera).

                Cicadas and hoppers are a very heterogeneous group with a great variety of shapes and habitats, but they all share a very important characteristic: their mouth is modified into a long beak to suck liquids. In many cases, this beak arises from the rear part of the head, very close to the front legs. All homopterans feed on plants, and many species are crop pests. These insects weaken the plants by sucking out large amounts of sap. Many species also inject toxins that damage the plant.
